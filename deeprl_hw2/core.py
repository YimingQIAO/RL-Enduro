class Sample:
    """Represents a reinforcement learning sample.

    Used to store observed experience from an MDP. Represents a
    standard `(s, a, r, s', terminal)` tuple.

    Note: This is not the most efficient way to store things in the
    replay memory, but it is a convenient class to work with when
    sampling batches, or saving and loading samples while debugging.

    Parameters
    ----------
    state: array-like
      Represents the state of the MDP before taking an action. In most
      cases this will be a numpy array.
    action: int, float, tuple
      For discrete action domains this will be an integer. For
      continuous action domains this will be a floating point
      number. For a parameterized action MDP this will be a tuple
      containing the action and its associated parameters.
    reward: float
      The reward received for executing the given action in the given
      state and transitioning to the resulting state.
    next_state: array-like
      This is the state the agent transitions to after executing the
      `action` in `state`. Expected to be the same type/dimensions as
      the state.
    is_terminal: boolean
      True if this action finished the episode. False otherwise.

class Preprocessor:

    This is a suggested interface for the preprocessing steps. You may

    interface to suit your needs.

    Preprocessor can be used to perform some fixed operations on the
    raw state from an environment. For example, in ConvNet based
    networks which use image as the raw state, it is often useful to
    convert the image to greyscale or downsample the image.

    Preprocessors are implemented as class so that they can have
    internal state. This can be useful for things like the
    AtariPreproccessor which maxes over k frames.

    If you're using internal states, such as for keeping a sequence of
    inputs like in Atari, you should probably call reset when a new
    episode begins so that state doesn't leak in from episode to
    episode.

    We have found this to be a useful interface for the replay

    It is expected that the replay memory has implemented the

    not need the end_episode method, and you may want to tweak the
    append method. This will make the sample method easy to implement
    (just randomly draw samples saved in your memory).

    However, the above approach will waste a lot of memory (as states
    will be stored multiple times in s as next state and then s' as
